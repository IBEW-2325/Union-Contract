# **ARTICLE 12 \- Shop Stewards**    {#article-12---shop-stewards}

**12.1**	The Union shall have the right to appoint a reasonable number of Shop Stewards. Upon appointment, the Union will notify the Employer, in writing, of the Shop Stewards’ name and office location. The duties of the Shop Steward shall be to report and investigate any violations of this Agreement. In no instance shall the Shop Steward be discriminated against or disciplined for discharging such duties, provided such duties do not unreasonably interfere with the regular performance of their work for the Employer.  

**12.2**	When a new Employee is on-boarded, they will be provided with a document created by the Union with information about their rights and privileges as a Union member, as well as information about how to connect with the Union along with the Employee’s representatives and Shop Stewards.

**12.3**	When applicable, management will provide the Union weekly with a list of new hires and, within their first week of employment, management will permit the opportunity for a meeting of up to thirty (30) minutes, in private and on work time, with a Union Representative or Shop Steward to orient them to the Union and answer any questions they may have. The Union is responsible for scheduling such meetings with Employees. Whenever practicable, a single meeting shall be conducted with all new Employees who started within an applicable two (2) week period.

**12.4**	The Union shall furnish to the Employer a complete list of Shop Stewards, which shall be amended from time to time as may be necessary. The Employer agrees to grant one (1) day of paid leave for Steward Training and Education when appointed. The Union must notify the Employer at least two (2) weeks in advance of any requested leave for Steward Training and Education, and the Employer shall not unreasonably deny a request for leave for this purpose. In the event that the Employer does not approve a request for leave due to the Employer’s legitimate business needs, the parties shall cooperate to schedule expeditiously an alternative date for Steward Training and Education.
