**23.1	Voting:** Employees who are eligible voters will, whenever possible, vote outside of working hours or by absentee ballot where those options are available.  In circumstances where an Employee is not eligible to vote by absentee ballot and the Employee’s work schedule does not allow sufficient time to vote, Employees shall receive two (2) hours, without loss of pay, to vote at either the beginning or end of the regular working shift, whichever allows sufficient time for voting and the least time off from the regular working shift. Employees will inform their supervisor of their need to take time off to vote at least two (2) days in advance and mutually agree to a reasonable time.

**23.3	Jury Duty and Legal Proceedings:** An Employee who is required to report for, or to serve on, jury duty will be expected to work on days when the jury is not in session. 

**23.3.A** 	Employees serving on the jury shall not be required to work hours other than those during which the Employee is normally scheduled.

**23.4**	Time spent at legal proceedings at the request of the Employer or Employer’s counsel shall be compensated at straight time rates. Such compensation shall also be paid for time spent at the request of any law enforcement agency, involving investigation or legal proceeding, for the benefit of the Employer, provided the Employee has given their supervisor prompt notice of the request.

**23.5	Military Leave:** The Employer shall grant the employee with the necessary leave to fulfill the annual training requirements of the unit in which they serve. Such employee shall give the employer no less than two (2) weeks’ prior notice where possible. 

**23.6	Bereavement Leave:** The Employer recognizes that Employees and all people make and choose their own families. Accordingly, the Employer will grant five (5) days paid bereavement leave for the death of any person identified by the Employee as “family” and which necessitates the Employee taking the leave. It is understood that this provision requires trust on the part of the Employer and shall not be abused by Employees.

**23.7	Paid Family and Medical Leave:** In order to be eligible for paid Family and Medical Leave, an Employee must have worked for the Employer for at least twelve (12) months before the start of the leave. Any eligible Employee shall be entitled to a total of twelve (12) weeks of leave during any twelve (12) month period. The Employer may require requests for leave to be supported by documentation from a health care provider. Acceptable reasons for medical leave include, but are not limited to, the birth of the Employee's child, care of newborn, adoption or placement of a child in the Employee's home for foster care; to care for an Employee's family member who has a serious health or chronic condition; and/or to care themselves when experiencing a serious health or chronic condition that makes the Employee unable to perform essential job functions.
