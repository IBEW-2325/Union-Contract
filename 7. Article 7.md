# **ARTICLE 7 \- Strikes or Lockouts**    {#article-7---strikes-or-lockouts}

**7.1**	The Employer believes that the right to strike, and the right of Employees to withhold labor in response to unacceptable workplace conditions, is a fundamental right that should be neither abridged nor abused. Accordingly, the Employer hereby foregoes a no-strike clause in this Agreement.  
**7.2**	The Employer believes that Employer-instituted lockouts of Employees impinge on Employees' exercise of rights guaranteed by federal law. Accordingly, the Employer hereby commits not to lock out its Employees for any reason or under any circumstance for the duration of this Agreement. 

**7.3**	The Employer recognizes the rights of unionized Employees to strike in labor disputes, and as such, will honor all legal picket lines and not force any IBEW member covered under this agreement to cross another labor Unionâ€™s picket line.

**7.4**	The Union recognizes the important and time-sensitive work performed by the Employer and both parties express their mutual desire and intent to resolve any labor disputes amicably and through mutual discussion whenever possible.
