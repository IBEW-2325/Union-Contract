# **ARTICLE 10 \- Gender Neutrality**     {#article-10---gender-neutrality}

**10.1**	The Employer will issue a written rule requiring everyone at the workplace or engaged in the Employer's business to speak or refer to transgender and non-binary Employees by the names they choose and the pronouns they identify with.

**10.2**	The Employer will change all records so that all records refer to transgender and non-binary Employees by the names they choose and the pronouns they identify with, unless the Employee requests the Employer to refrain from changing its records. The Employer will also update any photographs, including identification badges, unless the Employee requests otherwise. It is the Employeeâ€™s responsibility to notify the Employer of any changes in their name or pronouns.

**10.3**	The Employer respects the rights of all Employees to make their pronouns known and to have their identity honored. The Employer also respects the rights of those Employees who do not wish to state their pronouns during meetings or other work events. Supervisors and Employees will carefully consider when it makes sense to have pronouns be a part of introductions at meetings, as a way to live the Employer's values and balance the preferences of all Employees.

**10.4**	The Employer will use gender neutral language in all Employer produced on-boarding materials and policy manuals.
