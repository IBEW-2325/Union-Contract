**8.3**	The Employer's failure to exercise any right, prerogative, or function hereby reserved to it, or the Employer's exercise of any such right, prerogative, or function in a particular way, shall not be considered a waiver of the Employer's right to exercise such right, prerogative, or function or preclude it from exercising the same in some other way not in conflict with the express provisions of this Agreement.

**8.4**	The parties recognize that all Employees covered by this Agreement shall perform the services and duties prescribed by the Employer and shall be governed by Employer rules, policies, regulations, directives, and orders, provided that such rules, regulations, and orders are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement or state or federal laws.
