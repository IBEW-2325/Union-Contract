# **ARTICLE 15 \- Discipline and Discharge**    {#article-15---discipline-and-discharge}

**15.1**	If an Employee is written up by a supervisor for an infraction, it shall be done so within five (5) working days of said infraction or within five (5) working days of when such infraction became known to the Employer’s representative who has the authority to act. If a bargaining unit Employee is disciplined, they shall have the right to have a Shop Steward present at the disciplinary meeting. 

**15.2**	Copies of all disciplinary notices shall be sent to the Union at the time of issuance and placed in the Employee’s personnel file. All notices and warnings shall not be used for progressive discipline purposes one (1) year from the date of issue, unless the Employee has received another notice, warning, or discipline of another offense within the one (1) year period.

**15.3**	After completion of the ninety (90) day probationary period set out in this Agreement, the Employer shall have the right to discharge or discipline any Employee, in the form of verbal documented warning, written letter of warning, unpaid suspension, demotion, and discharge, for just cause. While different offenses may warrant different levels of discipline, a general principle to be applied is that discipline should be progressive. For offenses that warrant progressive discipline, the generally appropriate progression is: verbal documented warning, written letter of warning, written suspension, termination. The Employer retains discretion to commence progressive discipline at any step, including termination, based on the circumstances of the case.

**15.4**	If an Employee is discharged, the Employer shall give notice of the reason(s) in writing for the discharge at the time the action is taken. The Employer may immediately place the Employee into a non-pay status, in order to investigate an allegation where there is reasonable cause to believe that the Employee has engaged in sexual or other harassment, violence, theft, destruction of Employer property, making a statement that may cause serious reputational harm to the Movement Labs or its candidates or elected officials, or is guilty of a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment can be imposed. If charges of the foregoing are sustained by an arbitrator, and the Employer has sought termination, the termination shall stand.

**15.5	Just Cause:** No Employee shall be disciplined or discharged under the Employer’s  
Handbook, or this Agreement, except for Just Cause. All sections in Article 15 are hereby  
incorporated into this paragraph.

**15.6**	The Employer shall not be required to follow the provisions of Articles 15.1 \- 15.5 with respect to Employees who have worked ninety (90) or fewer since their initial hire date. Such Employees shall be considered probationary and shall not have access to the grievance process to challenge discipline or discharge, but shall be entitled to all other provisions of the Agreement.
