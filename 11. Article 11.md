# **ARTICLE 11 – Seniority**    {#article-11-–-seniority}

**11.1**	An Employee's seniority date shall be the Employee’s first day of work with the Employer, as either a bargaining unit or non-bargaining unit Employee. Except as provided in Articles 11.2 \- 11.4, Employees shall retain their original seniority date only while continuously employed by the Employer. For purposes of this provision, Employees shall be deemed continuously employed by the Employer while on approved leave of absence and while employed in a non-bargaining unit position.

**11.1.A**	In the event that more than one (1) Employee has the same seniority date, seniority will be determined by a drawing of cards from a standard deck of playing cards shuffled six (6) times, where aces are low and the suits go in alphabetical order from clubs (lowest), diamonds, hearts, and spades (highest). In this situation, the Employee who draws the highest card shall be considered to have the most seniority, and so on.

**11.2	Probationary Employees:** The first ninety (90) days of employment shall be considered to be a probationary period. The Employer reserves the right to release a new Employee, during the probationary period of ninety (90) days without recourse from the Union.

**11.3	Layoff & Recall: ** For purposes of Article 11.3 only, when an Employee is hired, they will be classified as either a continuing or termed Employee. A continuing Employee is hired with the expectation of continued employment in accordance with this Agreement and the Employer’s Handbook. A termed Employee is hired with the expectation their employment will end on a specific or approximate date. The Employer will convey that specific or approximate date to the termed Employee immediately upon hire.   
**11.3.A** 	If it becomes necessary for the Employer to reduce the workforce, the Employer will inform the Union at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to such action. The twenty (20) days’ notice is not applicable when a temporary layoff is due to a natural disaster or emergency situation.

**11.3.B** 	Continuing Employees or termed Employees who are laid off prior to their term date will be provided with at least twenty (20) days’ notice of impending layoff and paid through their layoff date. Employees who are laid off are expected to work up to their layoff date and all health benefits will remain in effect until the end of the month worked. These provisions shall not apply to any Employee who is terminated in accordance with Articles 15 and 16 of this Agreement. The ending of a particular campaign or contract, which by virtue of its end renders termed Employees no longer necessary, does not trigger layoff/reduction in workforce provisions.

**11.3.C.**	Employees who are laid off will retain their original seniority date for up to eighteen (18) months. Should new bargaining unit positions be created within six (6) months of layoffs, they will be offered first to Employees who were laid off and filled by seniority, subject to their experience and qualifications.

**11.4**	Any regular full-time Employee on the seniority list inducted into military, naval, air, or marine service, under the provisions of the Federal Selective Service Act or who voluntarily enlists in the services or who is compulsorily inducted by the Federal Government into employment in a defense industry, will be considered on a leave of absence and will accumulate seniority during such compulsory military service, voluntary military service, or training period. Upon the termination of such service, such Employee will be employed in line with the Employee’s seniority rights at the then current rate of such work, provided the Employee has been honorably discharged from the service of the United States Government and is able to do the work from the date of discharge from such service of the United States Government.

**11.5	Job Postings:** The Employer shall send an email to all IBEW bargaining unit members covered under this Agreement that lists open positions that are posted on the Employer’s website. If an Employee within the same department applies, in the case of a lateral move within the same classification, seniority will be considered as a factor in filling the position. Nothing in this Section shall prevent the Employer from also considering applicants’ qualifications, geographic location, political relationships, connections to the community where the position is located, whether they have completed their current job assignment, or other considerations relevant to the Employer’s interest in filling positions with the individuals best suited to carry out the mission of the Employer.

**11.5.A** 	In addition to the Employer’s website, the Employer shall work in good faith to post open positions to job board websites whose mission is to recruit and promote a workforce of diverse backgrounds and personal identities.

**11.6 	Severance Pay:**  
	Employees will be entitled to severance equal to one-month salary, plus one additional half month for each year, in which the Employee has been employed by the company. This will not apply to staff terminated for just cause or for staff working less than 100 days.

**11.7	References:**   
	Bargaining Unit employees will be entitled to at least a neutral professional reference, i.e., a  	confirmation, upon request, of their dates of employment, job title(s) held, and salary information.  	Letters for employees who are laid off shall include language that specifies that the employment 	term ended due to a layoff and was unrelated to the employee’s performance.

**11.8**	**Position Rotation:**  
Employer is focused on the continued growth and development of all Employees. For that reason, after no more than 3.5 years in a particular role, bargaining unit employees will begin a process of cross-training and transitioning and potentially transitioning into a new role. The transition process into a new role will be supervised by the Executive Director and Chief of Staff in collaboration with their supervisor. If no role is selected, then they will begin a training program working within 3 departments over the course of six months to develop competence and find a role in a new department or accept substantially new responsibilities within their current department. If, after six months the Executive Director and Chief of Staff determine that no new position is suitable, the Employee may continue working in their current role until the Executive Director and Chief of Staff find a new department or new responsibilities for the employee. If it is the employees desire to remain in their current role and not transition into a new role, then the employee will meet with the Executive Director, Chief of Staff and Union Representative to discuss the reason for remaining in their current role.
