# **ARTICLE 16 \- Grievance & Arbitration Procedures**    {#article-16---grievance-&-arbitration-procedures}

**16.1**	Differences between the Employer and the Union as to the application or interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement, including the question of whether an Employee has been disciplined or discharged for just cause, shall be settled by the following grievance and arbitration procedures. 

**16.2	Grievance Procedure** \- The parties shall strive to discuss all grievances in good faith and to resolve all issues prior to the formal grievance process or, if a grievance is filed, at the lowest possible step. The parties shall work in good faith to ensure that all facts and arguments are made at the lowest possible step of the grievance process.  

**16.2.A**	The Employer will comply with reasonable information requests from the Union for preparation of the grievance(s). Such compliance does not include releasing attorney/client privileged communications. 

**16.2.B	Step 1:** The Employee, with their Shop Steward or Union Representative present, shall discuss any issues or complaints with a supervisor, or the Shop Steward or Union Representative shall discuss any issues or complaints with the appropriate member of Movement Labs management. Such discussion must take place within fourteen (14) days of the date on which the Employee or the Union learned or may reasonably have been expected to learn of the issue. This time limit will be extended to sixty (60) days for grievances over wages, benefits, sexual harassment or assault, or other egregious circumstances. The parties and, if necessary, the arbitrator will consider whether any delay beyond sixty (60) days is reasonable or excusable given the nature of the grieved issue. However, in no case will a delay extend beyond six (6) months.

**16.2.C	Step 2:** If the Employee’s issue or complaint is not resolved in Step 1, the Shop Steward or Union Representative shall submit a written grievance to the Chief of Staff or other Employee designated by the Employer within seven (7) days of the Step 1 discussion.

**16.2.C.1** 	The Employer shall respond to a written grievance, in writing, within ten (10) days of receipt of the written grievance. Failure to respond in writing within ten (10) days will result in the grievance being advanced to Step 3\.

**16.2.D	Step 3:** Unresolved grievances may be appealed to Step 3 by sending notice of the appeal and relevant supporting documents to the Executive Director of Movement Labs. Such appeals must be received by the Executive Director within seven (7) days of receipt of the Step 2 decision. The Executive Director, or their designee, and Union representative shall schedule a meeting to discuss the grievance within three (3) workdays of the Employer’s receipt of the appeal. These time limits may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties.  

**16.2.D.1** 	The Executive Director shall issue a written Step 3 decision within five (5) workdays of the Step 3 meeting.

**16.2.D.2** 	If the grievance is not resolved at Step 3 the Union may appeal the grievance to expedited arbitration in accordance with Article 16.4.

**16.3	Grievance Mediation:** Prior to arbitration, both the Employer and the Union agree to make a good faith effort to utilize Grievance Mediation sponsored by the Labor Relations Connection (“LRC”) as a means of settling grievances, unless the parties waive this step by agreement. Should the Employer and the Union mutually agree to use Grievance Mediation, the following provisions will apply:

**16.3.A**	The findings and decision of the mediator are advisory only and not binding upon parties.

**16.3.B**	Should the issue proceed to arbitration, neither party shall make reference to the mediation process, its findings or decision.

**16.3.C**	Any mediation expenses that may be charged by the LRC for their services shall be borne equally by both parties.

**16.4	Arbitration:** The Union shall have up to ten (10) calendar days after the response in Step 3 to notify the Employer by letter or other mutually agreeable means of its intent to arbitrate any unresolved grievance. 

**16.4.A**	The matter shall proceed immediately to arbitration, unless either party demands expedited arbitration. The parties will mutually agree to use the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services and their procedures for obtaining an arbitrator. 

**16.4.B**	At the outset of any arbitration, prior to opening the record for evidence, the arbitrator must first attempt to mediate the case for final resolution. In the event that the parties are unable to mediate their dispute successfully, the arbitrator shall commence the arbitration hearing. The fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties.

**16.4.C**	All decisions of the arbitrator shall be final. Nothing herein shall authorize the arbitrator to alter the terms and conditions of this Agreement or make a new agreement. The arbitrator may not award punitive damages. 

**16.5	Remedy Procedures:** Upon failure of either party to meet with the other to adjust a grievance when requested to do so or failure to comply with any final decision, the Business Manager of the Union or their designee and the Movement Labs Executive Director or their designee shall meet within seventy-two (72) hours to attempt to resolve the dispute. Failing to agree, the parties at their discretion shall be permitted all legal and economic recourse, including the right to strike, in support or enforcement of their demands notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement.

**16.6**	All monetary grievance settlements shall be submitted by separate check payable to the grievant(s)and a copy of the same sent to the Union for their records. Such settlements shall be paid as soon as practicable, but in no case longer than within two (2) pay periods of the settlement date, unless by mutual agreement.

**16.7	Right to Legal Assistance:** It is understood between the Employer and the Union that either party may use legal counsel at arbitration. It is further understood that the Employer may include in any stage of the grievance procedure an outside labor relations consultant or attorney and the Union may include an International Representative or attorney.

**16.8	Time Limits:** These time limits may be extended only by mutual agreement, in writing. Any grievance not presented or processed within the prescribed time limits specified herein will be deemed withdrawn with prejudice. Failure of any Employer representative to render a decision on a grievance presented to them within the time limit specified in Articles 16.1 \- 16.7 at the expiration of said time will automatically advance the grievance to the next step.

**16.9	Exclusion from Grievance Procedure:**  The “Witnesseth” Section of this Agreement is explicitly excluded from the grievance procedure.
