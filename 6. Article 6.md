**6.1	Membership Fee Deductions**: The Employer agrees to deduct membership fees, from the bi-monthly wages of Employees in the bargaining unit who provide the Employer with a voluntary written authorization to do so. Such deductions shall be made by the Employer each payroll period, from the wages of Employees. Within seven (7) days after each pay period, the Employer shall forward such payroll deductions to the Business Manager/Financial Secretary of the Union, indicating the Employeeâ€™s name, Employee ID number (if applicable), and the amount deducted for each Employee. The Employer shall make every effort to include, in the identifying information concerning the deductions, the date for which the deductions were made, regular membership fees, and additional amounts deducted to repay shortages in membership fees paid due to absences. 

**6.2**	The Employer agrees that it will utilize current technological capabilities and/or check to electronically transfer membership fees, as well as updated Employee information, to the Union. The parties agree that they will cooperate with one another to accomplish this objective.

**6.3**	The Union hereby agrees that it will indemnify and hold the Employer harmless from any claims, actions, or proceedings by any Employee arising from deductions made by the Employer under this Agreement. If an incorrect deduction is made and submitted to the Union, the Union shall refund any such amount directly to the involved Employee.
