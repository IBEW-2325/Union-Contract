# **ARTICLE 18 \- Hours and Schedules** 

	  
**18.1	Flexible Hours & Work Product Emphasis**: Employer grants employees, in coordination with their supervisors, the ability to flexibly choose their hours of work on an ongoing basis. The emphasis for an employee's supervision will be their work product, \- their effectiveness at completing all tasks diligently, and working as a team-member to constantly improve and support the team’s growth \- not when hours are worked.

**18.2**    **Meetings and Responsiveness**: Employees are expected to be at their laptop for all scheduled meetings. They are expected to default to being responsive to Slack and email from colleagues and supervisors during conventional work hours (roughly 9-6 local time). Working with their supervisor they may post OOO notices on their calendars and the company vacation calendar if they would like to be unresponsive during conventional work hours. Employees are not required to respond to after hours or weekend Slack or emails immediately unless they are urgent. 

**18.3	Absence:** Employees are expected to report to work as scheduled. Employees are required to notify their supervisor of an unscheduled absence at least thirty (30) minutes prior to their scheduled start time, if possible. If the absence is unexpected and based on an emergency, Employees must report their absence as soon as practicable.

**18.4	Breaks:** The Employer expects all IBEW members covered under this Agreement to take the rest necessary to perform at their highest abilities. The Employer recognizes that Employees may take rest and meal breaks at a reasonable duration, time, and place of their choosing, consistent with the Employer’s direction to achieve the completion of time-sensitive work. Where the nature of an Employee’s work on a given day requires coverage at particular times, an Employee should collaborate with the Employee’s supervisor to facilitate the coordination of coverage for the Employee during breaks.
