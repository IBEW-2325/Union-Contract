  **21.2**	It is expected that some Employees may be required to work on holidays from time to time. If an Employee is required to work on a holiday, that Employee is entitled to a paid holiday of equal duration to the missed holiday. The Employee will work with their direct supervisor to find a different day to take off and make up for working on an office holiday. Under no circumstances will a missed holiday that falls on a Monday or Friday be made up by the employee taking a holiday on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, except at the explicit request of the employee.


  There may be a time where the Employer requires an entire team, department, or the entire workforce to work on a holiday. In that situation, the Employer will make Employees aware at least ten (10) days in advance, and the above paragraph shall apply to each employee.


  **21.3**	The Employer will honor the holiday on the day of the holiday if it falls on any weekday. If a holiday falls on a Saturday, the Employer will observe the holiday on the Friday before the holiday. If a holiday falls on a Sunday, the Employer will observe the holiday on the Monday following the holiday.


  **21.4**	Full-time and part-time Employees are eligible for paid holidays immediately upon hire. Employees will receive holiday pay in compliance with state and federal wage and hour laws.


  **21.5	Religious Accommodation**: The Movement Labs respects the religious beliefs and practices of all Employees. It is committed to reasonably accommodating the religious practices of its Employees, unless doing so would create an undue hardship to its business. The Employer shall accommodate the specific bona fide religious holiday day off requested by the Employee. If an Employee wishes to request religious accommodation, they must submit a written request explaining to the Employer’s Executive Director the deviation from regular work requirements needed because of their religious belief at least fourteen (14) days in advance. The Employer will evaluate the request considering, as appropriate, the requested accommodation and available alternatives. The Executive Director will review the request and communicate a response within five (5) workdays of the request.
