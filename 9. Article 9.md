# **ARTICLE 9 \- No Discrimination & Equal Employment Opportunity**     {#article-9---no-discrimination-&-equal-employment-opportunity}

**9.1**	The Employer shall make every effort to hire, retain, and promote a workforce of diverse backgrounds and personal identities, including but not limited to race, creed, color, age, sex, gender identity or expression, national origin, physical and/or mental ability, ancestry, nationality, mental health diagnosis, immigration status, affectional or sexual orientation, marital or domestic partnership or civil union status, parental status, or military service status.

**9.2**	Neither the Employer nor the Union shall discriminate against any Employee with respect to any terms or conditions of employment on account of race, creed, color, religion, age, sex, gender identity or expression, national origin, physical and/or mental disability, ancestry, nationality, mental health diagnosis, immigration status, exercising rights under the OSH Act (Whistleblower Protection), affectional or sexual orientation, marital or domestic partnership or civil union status, parental status, liability for military service, past or present member of the uniformed services, genetic information, atypical cellular or blood trait, domestic violence victim status, and any other basis protected by applicable law, ordinance, or regulation. Neither the Employer nor the Union shall discriminate against any Employee because of their membership in or activities on behalf of the Union or because of their refusal to join, support, or engage in activities on behalf of the Union, except as provided in Article 5\. Nothing herein shall be construed as waiving an Employee’s right to pursue a claim of discrimination before an administrative agency or court of law.

**9.3**	Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Employer from taking any action necessary to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. If an Employee who experiences a disability desires an accommodation, the Employee must contact the Executive Director and submit any required documentation, which will be kept confidential and used solely for the purpose of verifying the disability and identifying reasonable accommodations under the law. If a reasonable accommodation can be identified, it will be provided with reasonable promptness, and in no event in more than thirty (30) days, of the Employee contacting management unless the thirty (30) day time frame creates an undue hardship to the Employer. 

**9.4**	Reasonable accommodations made by the Employer for a particular Employee shall not be considered as precedent in any subsequent situation and shall not be evidence of disparate treatment in any grievance or arbitration procedure contained in this Agreement.

**9.5	Ban the Box**: The Employer shall adhere to all applicable laws governing pre-employment inquiries with respect to prospective Employees' criminal histories. The Employer will not ask about criminal history or conduct a background check on a potential Employee prior to interviewing the potential Employee. Consistent with the Employer’s values, the Employer will not deny a potential Employee employment on the basis of criminal history, unless the potential Employee’s criminal history is, in the Employer’s judgment, related to the job or suggests that the potential Employee may pose an unreasonable risk to others’ safety and/or the Employer’s reputation if hired.

**9.6**	The Employer does not tolerate offenses \-- criminal or otherwise \-- of a sexually abusive or harassing nature. As a means of ensuring that all of its Employees are protected from sexually abusive or harassing conduct, demonstrated evidence of such conduct shall be a basis for the Employer to refrain from hiring an employee or for immediate separation from employment should such conduct subsequently come to light.
